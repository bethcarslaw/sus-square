      <strong>6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <em>In Short:&nbsp;</em>
      </strong>
      <em>
        If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media
        account, we may have access to certain information about you.
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your
      third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter
      logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
      information about you from your social media provider. The profile
      information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider
      concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list,
      and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make
      public on such a social media platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
      described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you
      on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not
      responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your
      third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their
      privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your
      personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on
      their sites and apps.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <em>In Short:&nbsp;</em>
      </strong>
      <em>
        We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes
        outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary
      for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention
      period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other
      legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping
      your personal information for longer than the period of time in which
      users have an account with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
      information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if
      this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has
      been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
      information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <em>In Short:&nbsp;</em>
      </strong>
      <em>
        We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
        organisational and technical security measures.
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
      organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any
      personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
      efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
      Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
      secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or
      other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security
      and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
      Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
      transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your
      own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.
    </p>

      <strong>9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <em>In Short:</em>
      </strong>
      <em>
        &nbsp;In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United
        Kingdom (UK), and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access

      <strong>
        <u>Withdrawing your consent:</u>
      </strong>
      &nbsp;If we are relying on your consent to process your personal
      information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the
      applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
      You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the
      contact details provided in the section &#39;{" "}
      <a href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>
      &#39; below.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the
      processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it
      affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance
      on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

      <strong>
        <u>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</u>

      service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use
      of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other
      non-marketing purposes.

      <strong>Account Information</strong>

      <strong>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
      applications include a Do-Not-Track (&#39;DNT&#39;) feature or setting you
      can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
      online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
      uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals
      has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
      signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice
      not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
      that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice
      in a revised version of this privacy notice.

      <strong>11. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong>

      California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the &#39;Shine The
      Light&#39; law, permits our users who are California residents to request
      and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about
      categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties
      for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third
      parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately
      preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like
      to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using
      the contact information provided below.

      If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a

      unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request removal
      of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided

      backups, etc.).

      In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or

        Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer&rsquo;s
        Privacy Rights

    <p>
      We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.

    <p>
      <u>Verification process</u>
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
      determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in
      our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide
      information so that we can match it with information you have previously
      provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we
      may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
      information you provide with the information we already have on file, or
      we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email)
      that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other
      verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify
      your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we
      will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of
      verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the
      information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide
      additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for
      security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally
      provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
    </p>

        You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or

        You can designate an authorised agent to make a request under the CCPA
        on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorised agent that does
        not submit proof that they have been validly authorised to act on your
        behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You may request to opt out from future selling of your personal
        information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will

        fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.
